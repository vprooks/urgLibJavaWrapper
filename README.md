# URG Library Java Wrapper 

JNA wrapper of C library [urg\_library](https://sourceforge.net/projects/urgnetwork/files/urg_library/) Java. Bindings are generated using [JNAerator](https://github.com/nativelibs4java/JNAerator).

To make the wrapper actually work, make the C library and put the shared library into `src/main/resources/<Platform>`.
